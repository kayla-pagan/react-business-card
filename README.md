# react-business-card

This is a simple project but this was my first React project!
It was a bit challenging but not as difficult as I was making it out to be
before I started learning. I was able to practice the following in this 
project: 

    -JSX syntax
    -Creating custom components for the contents of my page
    -Using className to add styling
